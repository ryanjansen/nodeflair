# Coding Tasks

## How to use

This repo is split into two folders. 

"Responsive" is for the frontend task and contains a html and css file. Just open the index.html file in a browser to view it.

"React" is for the simple image picker react app. To start the app, follow the following steps:

1. Clone the directory
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

# Product Thinking - How to improve Web Traffic

## Platform to submit and review applications

One of the issues with job sites is that the application process is complicated. This is exacerbated if different job listings use different sites, each with their own process. Users are left trying to figure out how to apply instead of what is important - the content of their application.  We can improve this process of applying to jobs by creating a simple, streamlined platform where users can upload the necessary infomation and respond to any potential offers. This will also encourage users to return to NodeFlair due to the ease of use, as well as to check on their existing applications, thus increasing the recurring web traffic to the site.

## Job prep tools catered to tech workers

A key differentiator of NodeFlair is our focus on tech careers. In this industry, there are clear technical requirements for certain roles. Preparing these skills for an interview can be a difficult process. I suggest that we help users to test their skills through tools designed to mimic the challanges they might face in an interview. One example is a checklist of common HTML questions for a frontend interview. Another might be a list of coding challanges (such as this one!) that they might want to attempt before going for an interview. This will increase users confidence and give them an incentive to return to the site to brush up their skills.

## Similar Jobs 

Most tech workers are more familiar with a certain area of tech such as full stack development or DevOps. As such , they will tend to look for certain roles on the site. I suggest that we improve their browsing experience by listing to similar jobs in the each job listing. For example, a job listing for a frontend role could link to any other companies that are also looking for frontend developers. This will encourage the user to look at these different companies and increase the time spent on our site.

# Areas for improvement

My main goal for this internship is to have the chance to work in a startup environment and cope with the challanges of real-world production. I would love to have the opportunity to understand what the day to day looks like and how teams operate to get things done. I also look forward to working with talented developers who can help me grow both technically and collaboratively. Through this process I hope to improve my ability to work well in a team and to produce efficient and effective code that solves real world problems.
